Indian Recipe Chatbot
This project is a simple web-based chatbot that provides users with Indian recipe instructions. The chatbot responds to user queries about how to prepare various Indian dishes like chapati, biryani, paneer butter masala, and dosa. The website includes animated chat messages for a visually appealing experience.

Features
Interactive Chatbot: Users can type in recipe-related questions, and the bot will respond with step-by-step instructions for popular Indian recipes.
Smooth Animations: The chatbot messages appear with a smooth fade-in animation, enhancing the user experience.
Responsive Design: The chatbot window is designed to be responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes.
Predefined Responses: The bot recognizes specific recipe queries, such as "how to make chapati," "how to make biryani," and others, and provides predefined responses for each.
Technology Stack
HTML5: Used for the structure and layout of the web page.
CSS3: For styling the chat interface and adding smooth animations to the chat messages.
JavaScript: For the chatbot logic, handling user input, and generating bot responses.
How It Works
User Input: The user types a question, such as "how to make chapati."
Bot Response: Based on the user's input, the chatbot provides a recipe response from a predefined set of recipes.
Animations: Each chat message (whether from the user or the bot) is displayed with a fade-in animation.
Auto Scrolling: The chat window automatically scrolls down as new messages are added.
Recipe Responses
The chatbot is programmed to respond to the following queries:

"how to make chapati": Provides the ingredients and instructions for making chapati.
"how to make biryani": Provides the recipe for making biryani.
"how to make paneer butter masala": Explains how to prepare paneer butter masala.
"how to make dosa": Gives the steps to make dosa batter and cook dosa.
If the user asks about a recipe that the bot does not recognize, it will return a fallback response:

"Sorry, I don't know that recipe. Try asking about 'chapati', 'biryani', 'paneer butter masala', or 'dosa'."
